# CS Advising Assistant Project
CS 300: DSA Analysis and Design
<br/>
<br/>(From the SNHU CS-210 Syllabus)
<br/>Students will develop code as well as use non-coding development methodologies in algorithmic design and problem-solving. Students will use advanced algorithmic designs to evaluate complex data structures to aid in problem-solving.

# Course Competencies
This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills relevant to the field:
<br/>CS-30398: Apply non-coding development methodologies for outlining an algorithmic design
<br/>CS-30399: Develop code using algorithms and data structures to solve basic programming problems
<br/>CS-30400: Evaluate complex data structures that solve a given problem using advanced algorithmic designs

# Software and Tools
Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
